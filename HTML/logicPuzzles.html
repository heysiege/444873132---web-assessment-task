                Four people are crossing a bridge at night, so they all need a torchâ€”but they just have one that only lasts 15 minutes. Alice can cross in one minute, Ben in two minutes, Cindy in five minutes and Don in eight minutes. No more than two people can cross at a time; and when two cross, they have to go at the slower person&apos;s pace. How do they get across in 15 minutes?

                A bad guy is playing Russian roulette with a six-shooter revolver. He puts in one bullet, spins the chambers and fires at you, but no bullet comes out. He gives you the choice of whether or not he should spin the chambers again before firing a second time. Should he spin again?

                Yes. Before he spins, there&apos;s a one in six chance of a bullet being fired. After he spins, one of those chances has been taken away, leaving a one in five chance and making it more likely a bullet will be fired. Best to spin again.

                This one could also fall in the lying/truth category. A man is caught on the king&apos;s property. He is brought before the king to be punished. The king says, "You must give me a statement. If it is true, you will be killed by lions. If it is false, you will be killed by trampling of wild buffalo. If I can&apos;t figure it out, I&apos;ll have to let you go." Sure enough, the man was released. What was the man&apos;s statement?

                Solution: <br>
                "I will be killed by trampling of wild buffalo." This stumped the king because if it&apos;s true, he&apos;ll be killed by lions, which would render the statement not true. If it&apos;s a lie, he&apos;d be killed by wild buffalo, which would make it a truth. Since the king had no solution, he had to let the man go.

                There is a barrel with no lid and some wine in it. "This barrel of wine is more than half full," says the woman. "No, it&apos;s not," says the man. "It&apos;s less than half full."

                Tilt the barrel until the wine barely touches the lip of the barrel. If the bottom of the barrel is visible then it is less than half full. If the barrel bottom is still completely covered by the wine, then it is more than half full.

                Solution: <br>
                2 out of 3. You know you don&apos;t have Bag B. But because Bag A has two white marbles, you could have picked either marble; if you think of it as four marbles in total from Bags A and C, three white and one black, you&apos;ll have a greater chance of picking another white marble.

                A teacher writes six words on a board: "cat dog has max dim tag." She gives three students, Albert, Bernard and Cheryl each a piece of paper with one letter from one of the words. Then she asks, "Albert, do you know the word?" Albert immediately replies yes. She asks, "Bernard, do you know the word?" He thinks for a moment and replies yes. Then she asks Cheryl the same question. She thinks and then replies yes. What is the word?

            <div class="answer">
                Solution: <br>
                Dog. Albert knows right away because he has one of the unique letters that only appear once in all the words: c o h s x i. So, we know the word is not "tag." All of these unique letters appear in different words, except for "h" and "s" in "has," and Bernard can figure out what the word is from the unique letters that are left: t, g, h, s. This eliminates "max" and "dim." Cheryl can then narrow it down the same way. Because there is only one unique letter left, the letter "d," the word must be "dog."
